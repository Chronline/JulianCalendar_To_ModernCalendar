# JulianCalendar_To_ModernCalendar
A script made by a beginner for fun. Aim is to convert roman dates in modern dates.

**1° Choose a roman date coming from the Julian Calendar : a specific day before the feast*, a feast (Kalendes, Ides or Nones), and a month (in English or in Latin).

Eg: 3 before the Nones of September

*Please note that romans include the day in the counting. 1st kalendes is the day of kalendes itself. 2nd Kal is the day before.

**2° Choose if you want to input a consul's year. ! Function is still in beta. Some errors in the datation might happen !

If Yes, go to 3°
If No, go to 4°

**3° If Yes, you have to check the "consul database" in order to enter exactly the name (even new spaces are a mistake) you want. 

Then, you have to enter the number of times he was consulate.
Eg: the second consulate of C. Julius Caesar

*The database is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_consuls (consulted on the 23 april 2020)
*Due to a lack of time to check every data, mistakes can happen in case homonyms existed. 

**4° The script will run with or without the date from the consul database. (between parenthese is what is added if you run the consul database)

Eg: the 3th before the Nones of September (under the second consulate of C. Julius Caesar) is on the 3 September (44 B.C.).
